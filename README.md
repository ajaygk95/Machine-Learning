## Dataset
The linearly-separable-dataset is an artificial linearly separable dataset with the domain X = R<sup>2</sup>, and the label set Y = {0,1}.

The second is a Breast Cancer Prediction dataset. Diagnosis of breast cancer is performed when an abnormal lump is found (from self-examination or x-ray) or a tiny speck of calcium is seen (on an x-ray). In this dataset, there are 569 observations, with each observation consisting of 5 features (mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, mean area, mean smoothness). The last column is the diagnosis, where 0 indicates that the finding was benign, and 1 indicates that it was malignant.
